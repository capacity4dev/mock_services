# Installation

This mock server is build using the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) PHP
micro framework.


## Requirements

* Apache, Nginx, â€¦ (a web server that supports PHP).
* PHP 5.4 or higher.
* [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

You need [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to install required libraries.

Open the root directory of this repository and run (if you installed composer 
globally):

```

You can also download composer as a phar file into the root of the project and
install the required libraries:

## Create an Apache vhost

The server is hosted over http. You can use Apache (or another web server that
