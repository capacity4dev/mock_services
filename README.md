# Mock LDAP

This is a mock server that mimics the European Commission LDAP service.

The EC LDAP service provides the functionality to retrieve information about an
EC email address. It returns if the email address exists and some extra info
like the country the user is located in and the department he/she is working in.


## Installation

This mock server is build using the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) mini 
framework.

* Apache, Nginx, â€¦ (a web server that supports PHP).
* PHP 5.4 or higher.
* [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
